# Project Title
**Development of a Web Application Accounting System for Small and Medium-Sized Legal Firms**

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to create a cost-effective, efficient web application accounting system tailored for small and medium-sized legal firms to streamline their financial documentation and reporting procedures. This system addresses the unique accounting requirements of law firms, which differ from other organizations due to Bar Council regulations and the need for specialized processes.

## Background
Smaller law firms often find existing accounting software too expensive and not fully compatible with their specific needs. For example, Fan Chen Partnership, a small law firm in Kuala Lumpur, faces significant time and effort in manually reviewing records. This project intends to mitigate such issues by providing a tailored solution.

## Development Framework
The project employs the Agile Scrum Framework for development, gathering requirements through system comparisons and stakeholder interviews. The system focuses on three core functionalities:
- **Accounting Management**
- **Case File Management**
- **Client Management**

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Laravel framework
- **Frontend:** Vue.js framework
- **Integration:** Inertia.js seamless integration between Laravel and Vue.js, facilitating the development of single-page applications without the need for client-side routing and APIs.
- **User Interface:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a component-based approach in Vue.js for better productivity and reusability.

## Project Repository
The complete source code is available on GitHub: [legal-ace-sme](https://github.com/chairielazizi/legal-ace-sme). The repository includes folders for app, database, routes, and other related files for both frontend and backend development.

## Summary
By leveraging modern web development frameworks and methodologies, this project delivers a robust and user-friendly accounting system tailored for small legal firms, enhancing their operational efficiency and allowing them to better manage their finances, cases, and clients.d
